This project was developed using datasets from the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock of Zambia. For more information, please visit https://www.mfl.gov.zm/?page_id=1386.
The primary objective of this project was to investigate the consistency of meat prices in Lusaka over a 10-month period. It can be confirmed that some prices exhibited greater consistency than others,
but the general trend indicates that prices remained fairly consistent for most of this period.
Additionally, this project provides insights into the highest, lowest, and average prices for selected products, although not all products are displayed.
Please note that all prices are denominated in Zambian Kwacha and are per kilogram.
NOTE: Python was used to obtain these results, and the examples are in .ipynb format.
